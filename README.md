## Problem  
- Loyalty programs are centralized, costly, and inflexible.  
- Customers rarely see real, transparent rewards.  
- Blockchain adoption remains complex and intimidating for non-technical users.  
- Sustainability is often ignored in traditional cashback systems.  

This mechanism enables businesses and customers to offset emissions (such as the COâ‚‚ footprint of a meal or other purchased items) while engaging in everyday transactions.  

---

## Solution  
Lumina uses **smart contracts on Stellar** to deliver a **green cashback system**:  
- Cashback tokens are issued automatically with each purchase.  
- Tokens can be redeemed as discounts or converted into carbon credits.  
- Transparent rules (e.g., *5% cashback, valid for 6 months*) are enforced by the smart contract.  
- Customers interact through a simple, user-friendly interface â€” no blockchain expertise required.  

What makes Lumina unique is its focus on **usability and adoption**. Instead of requiring users to understand wallets, private keys, or technical details of blockchain, Lumina integrates seamlessly with a simple and familiar interface, where tokens are received and managed automatically. Businesses can configure transparent reward rules, while users experience blockchain benefits without needing technical expertise.
